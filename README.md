## Bootstrapping Basics

If you want to bootstrap Maven, you'll need:

- Java 1.7+
- Maven 3.0.5 or later

Run Maven, specifying a location into which the completed Maven distro should be installed:

```
mvn -DdistributionTargetDir="$HOME/app/maven/apache-maven-3.5.x-SNAPSHOT" clean package
```

Once the build completes, you should have a new Maven distro ready to roll in that directory!
